### Hi My Name Is Rj Carlo Domalanta From Gordon College, Im Currently 3rd Year Studying Bachelor of Science In Information Technology. Today My Project Is About Realtime Chat using Server And Client.

### Background
Creating a real-time chat application using sockets typically involves two main components: a server and a client. 

### Socket API Overview
Sockets provide a programming interface for network communication, allowing processes on different devices to communicate over a network. A socket is a software endpoint that establishes a communication link between two computers using a network protocol, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

### Client and Server
### Client

### Server

### Running the Client and Server
Running Using the Terminal.

### Multi-Connection Client and Server
We Open 3 multiple Client Server

### Sending an Application Message
We send a Message to all Clients in Same time

To Perform this Code We need to Run the Server before Running the Client Because Without The Server Wen't communicate to the Clients. After Running The Server We will start to run the Client, It's up to you How Many clients you want if its already run you can try to send a message to them.
